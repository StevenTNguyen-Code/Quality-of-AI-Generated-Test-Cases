I need functional test cases to cover all decisions in the methods of the class under testing. 
All conditional expressions must assume true and false values. 
Tests with Boundary Values are also mandatory. 
For numeric data, always use positive and negative values. 
Include all necessary imports. 
It is mandatory to throw Exceptions in all test method declarations. 
It is mandatory to include timeout=1000 in all @Test annotations. 
It is mandatory to test for the default constructor. 
Each method in the class under test must have at least one test case. 
Even simple or void methods must have a test calling it with valid inputs. 
@Test(expected= must be used only if the method under testing explicitly throws an exception. 
Test must be in JUnit 4 framework format. 
Test must be in Java 8. 
Test must run and compile successfully. 
Test set heather package and import dependencies: package ds; import org.junit.Test; import org.junit.Before; import static org.junit.Assert.*; import ds.*;
